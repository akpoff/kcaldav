.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file defines principals for a
.Xr kcaldav 8
instance.
It follows the syntax of
.Xr passwd 5 :
.Pp
.D1 name:pass:uid:gid:class:change:exp:gecos:home:shell
.Pp
The other fields are ignored.
.Pp
Each field can accept all characters but for the ASCII colon,
double-quotation mark, or backslash.
.Pp
The syntax for
.Nm ,
however, only requires the following fields:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Dv name
User's login name.
This is unique within the system.
.It Dv pass
The hashed password.
The hashing scheme is defined in RFC 2617.
Specifically, this is the MD5 hash of
.Li username \(dq:\(dq realm \(dq:\(dq password ,
where realm is the fixed string
.Li kcaldav .
The MD5 hash is stored as a 32-character hex string using lowercase
letters.
.It Dv gecos
This field contains the e-mail address, which need not have any relation
to the server hosting
.Xr kcaldav 8 .
.It Dv home_dir
Absolute path relative to calendar root.
This must end in a terminating slash.
.El
.Pp
You should
.Em only
edit this file with
.Xr kcaldav.passwd 1 .
This ensures that the proper advisory locks are set so that a running
.Xr kcaldav 8
doesn't read a half-written file.
Moreover, this file may
.Em not
be a symbolic link.
