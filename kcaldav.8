.Sh NAME
.Nm kcaldav
.Nd simple CalDav server
.\" .Sh LIBRARY
.\" For sections 2, 3, and 9 only.
.\" Not used in OpenBSD.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kcaldav
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
CGI program minimally implements CalDAV, with an emphasis on strong
authorisation and simplicity.
To use
.Nm ,
you'll need to first populate your
.Dv CALDIR
.Pq set during compile time
with a password file (for HTTP authorisation, see
.Xr kcaldav.passwd 5 ) ,
then for each collection (calendar directory), create a configuration
file (see
.Xr kcaldav.conf 5 )
defining the permissions of that collection and other information.
.Pp
Once finished, you can point your calendar client to the owned
collection within
.Dv CALDIR .
.Pp
For example, assume the script has been installed into
.Pa /var/www/cgi-bin
and is reachable at
.Pp
.D1 http://localhost/cgi-bin/kcaldav.cgi
.Pp
Moreover, assume
.Dv CALDIR
is set to
.Pa /var/www/caldav ,
which contains
.Pa kcaldav.passwd ;
and you have installed a single collection at
.Pa /var/www/caldav/kristaps
consisting of
.Pa kcaldav.conf
and some calendars.
You can point your browser to the following:
.Pp
.D1 http://localhost/cgi-bin/kcaldav.cgi/kristaps/
.Pp
Note the trailing slash, otherwise the request is interpreted as for a
resource (file), not a collection (directory).
