The
.Nm

.Nm kcaldav.conf ,
defines properties for a CalDAV collection.
It must be exist and be well-formed for each collection (file-system
directory), else that collection is not considered by
.Xr kcaldav 8 .
.Pp
The configuration file is line-based, with blank lines discarded.
See
.Xr fparseln 3
for implementation details.
At any point in the line you may begin a comment with the
.Qq #
character: the remainder of the line will be thrown away.
You may escape the comment token with a backslash.
Line endings may also be escaped with a backslash.
.Pp
Each line consists of a token and value separated by an equal sign (and
possibly white-space), such as
.Bd -literal -offset indent
privilege = kristaps ALL
displayname = Kristaps' Calendar
email-address-set = kristaps@bsd.lv
.Ed

Trailing and leading line white-space are discarded.

.It displayname

Privileges are case insensitive and may be
