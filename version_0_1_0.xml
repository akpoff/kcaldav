		Migrate to using <a
			href="https://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a> to
		store everything: nonces, collections, resources,
		configuration, and so on.
		This completely changes the existing file-system based
		infrastructure, which was too brittle.
		(All those permissions...)
		All existing functionality is preserved.
		If you're already using <span class="nm">kcaldav</span>,
		you'll need to upgrade by feeding your principal's
		calendars into <a
			href="kcaldav.passwd.1.html">kcaldav.passwd(1)</a>,
		which allows for creating calendar entries.
