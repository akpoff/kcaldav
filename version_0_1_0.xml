			Migrate to using <a href="https://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a> to store everything: nonces, collections, resources, configuration,
			and so on.
			This completely replaces the existing file-system based infrastructure, which was too brittle, with a single database file.
			All existing functionality is preserved, but there are some changes to be aware of if you're already using <span class="nm">kcaldav</span>.
			Foremost, you can now have multiple calendars, for now via <a href="kcaldav.passwd.1.html">kcaldav.passwd(1)</a>.
			To effect this change, all user calendars are now within subdirectories of the calendar root, e.g.,
			<code>/cgi-bin/kcaldav/kristaps/calendar/</code> instead of directly in <code>.../kristaps/</code>.
			iOS and iCal clients deal with this properly, but Thunderbird will need to point directly to the calendar collection.

			To migrate an existing installation, you'll need to create a new database file with <a href="kcaldav.passwd.1.html">kcaldav.passwd(1)</a>.
			Make sure that it's read-writable by the web server process.
			You'll then need to add your iCalendar files using the same tool.
			That's it!
