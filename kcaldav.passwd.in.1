.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kcaldav.passwd
.Op Fl cn
.Op Fl d Ar homedir
.Op Fl f Ar passdir
.Op Fl u Ar user
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program updates the
.Xr kcaldav.passwd 5
file for an instance of
.Xr kcaldav 8 .
By default, it changes the
.Pa @CALDIR@/kcaldav.passwd
password for the user with the currently logged-in username.
Its arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Create a new user.
The current real user (via
.Xr getuid 2 )
must match the password file owner to use this option.
Does nothing if a user by that name already exists.
.It Fl n
Do not change the user password, but only the user attributes (e.g.,
.Fl d ) .
.It Fl d Ar homedir
Change the home directory (within the
.Xr kcaldav 8
file-system root) of the requested user.
If unspecified and a new user is created with
.Fl c ,
this defaults to
.Pa /<user> .
This must be an absolute path.
.It Fl f Ar passdir
Specify an alternative password directory.
.It Fl u Ar user
Use an alternative username.
The current real user (via
.Xr getuid 2 )
must match the password file owner to use this option.
.El
.Pp
Since
.Nm
is designed for use in a multi-user system, and possibly one with
multiple
.Xr kcaldav.passwd 5
files, special care is taken for security.
.Bl -enum
.It
The
.Xr kcaldav.passwd 5
file is
.Em never
created by
.Nm .
You must manually create an empty password file.
The owner of the password file should be considered the administrator
(usually root, but local owners are ok).
The group of the password file should be the web server process.
The permissions should then be
.Li 0640 .
.It
You can then add new users with
.Fl c
using
.Xr sudo 8
or as the owner of the file directly.
.It
Existing users can then modify their own passwords with
.Xr sudo 8 .
If, however, the set-user-ID bit is set on the
.Nm
binary, and the owner of the binary is the same as the owner of the password
file, logged-in users can set their own passwords.
.El
.Pp
By using this somewhat contrived scheme, a standalone instance of
.Xr kcaldav 8
can have a local non-privileged administrator, adding and removing users
as she sees fit.
.Pp
If there's a system-wide
.Xr kcaldav 8
for use by logged-in users, the set-user-ID bits can be used to make
sure that users can only change passwords on their own accounts.
.Em Warning :
if you have multiple
.Xr kcaldav.passwd 5
files with overlapping usernames, users can try to change
.Qq their
passwords on other password files!
You can protect against this by having other non-system
.Xr kcaldav.passwd 5
files have different owners.
