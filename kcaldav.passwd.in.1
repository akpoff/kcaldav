.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kcaldav.passwd
.Op Fl Cn
.Op Fl d Ar directory
.Op Fl e Ar email
.Op Fl f Ar caldir
.Op Fl u Ar user
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program updates the database for an instance of
.Xr kcaldav 8 .
By default, it changes
.Pa @CALDIR@/kcaldav.db
for the user with the currently logged-in username, prompting for the
existing passwords when it does so.
Its arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C
Create a new user with a default email (see
.Fl e )
and calendar (see
.Fl d ) .
The current real user (via
.Xr getuid 2 )
must match the password database owner to use this option, or the real
user must be root.
Does nothing if a user by that name already exists.
If the database does not exist, creates it with the current real user
set as the database owner.
.It Fl n
Do not change the user password, but only the user attributes (e.g.,
.Fl e Ar email ) .
.It Fl d Ar directory
Add a calendar directory for the requested user, or set the default
directory if specified with
.Fl C .
If not specified with
.Fl C ,
the directory
.Dq calendar
is used.
.It Fl e Ar email
Change the e-mail address of the requested user.
This can be any email address.
If unspecified and the new user is created with
.Fl C ,
this defaults to
.Ar <user>@<hostname> ,
where the hostname is looked up with
.Xr gethostname 3
and defaults to localhost if there's no hostname set.
.It Fl f Ar passdir
Specify an alternative database directory.
.It Fl u Ar user
Use an alternative username.
The current real user (via
.Xr getuid 2 )
must match the password file owner to use this option, or the real user
must be root.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Since
.Nm
is designed for use in a multi-user system, and possibly one with
multiple
.Xr kcaldav 8
instances, it assumes that
.Nm
has been installed with the set-user-ID (or set-group-ID) bit (see
.Xr chmod 1 ) .
This allows administrators to have a single database for multiple users
that may only be accessed with
.Nm .
By way of example, consider a local UNIX installation with several local
users.
The
.Nm
binary is installed with the set-user-ID bit and the owner set as a
kcaldav dummy user.
The database is populated with
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# chown kcaldav /usr/local/bin/kcaldav.passwd
# chmod u+s /usr/local/bin/kcaldav.passwd
# sudo -u kcaldav kcaldav.passwd -C -u <user>
.Ed
.Pp
System users may then update their passwords as follows:
.Pp
.D1 % kcaldav.passwd
.Pp
The administrator may handle non-system users:
.Pp
.D1 # sudo -u kcaldav kcaldav.passwd -u <user>
.Pp
The simple behaviour of a single user creating a database and (for
example) modifying passwords is preserved:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% kcaldav.passwd -C
% kcaldav.passwd
