			<strong>Warning</strong>: you'll need to dump your
			database and regenerate it with the included schema
			file <span class="file">kcaldav.sql</span>.
			New columns and constraints have been added to support delegation as described below.
		</div>
		<div>
			Added proxy functionality (see <a
				href="http://svn.calendarserver.org/repository/calendarserver/CalendarServer/trunk/doc/Extensions/caldav-proxy.txt">caldav-proxy.txt</a>).
			This has been tested with Apple's iCal, but not with other systems.  
			Delegation can be set from the client or from the web interface.
		</div>
		<div>
			Make web-interface access to the <q>null</q> directory (e.g., /cgi-bin/kcaldav) automatically redirect to the root directory
			instead of crashing the system.
			Moreover, allow <q>probe</q> requests (<code>PROPFIND</code> on the script root) properly redirect to the authenticated principal.
			While there, move the entire web interface to use JSON and JavaScript instead of dynamic HTML.
			This makes it easier to extend or replace.
		</div>
		<div>
			Updated the underlying database routines to better handle failure conditions and added more documentation to the code
			and explanations of error conditions.
			Sandbox the entire running process with <a
				href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/sandbox_init.3.html">sandbox_init(3)</a>
			(only applicable on Mac OS X).
