		Properly URL-encode and decode calendar entities.
		This arises when some calendar systems (e.g., Google) use non-alphanumerics in their Calendar names.
		Also relax an overly-strict rule when parsing the recursive rules as found by Reyk Floeter.  
		(Right now, the system doesn't use the recursive rule, so it's safe to have insane dates.)
