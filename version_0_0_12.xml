		Implement a nonce database to prevent replay attacks for digest authentication.
		This follows <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617">RFC 2617</a> in maintaining a (bounded) database of nonce values and
		their counts.
		On first authentication, a new nonce field is created for the principal (possibly evicting the oldest nonce).
		Subsequent authentication must use this nonce as well as an increasing nonce-count.
		The methods are described in <a href="kcaldav.8.html">kcaldav(8)</a>.
		Also, have the gecos field in <a href="kcaldav.passwd.5">kcaldav.passwd(5)</a> contain the user's email address, then remove the
		email address field from <a href="kcaldav.conf.5">kcaldav.conf(5)</a>.
