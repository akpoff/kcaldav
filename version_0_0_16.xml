		Support the <code>calendar-description</code> element.
		Consolidate all properties into a single structure, allowing for flexible addition and removal of properties and property
		behaviour.
		This also removes a lot of conditional logic when responding to <code>PROPFIND</code> and <code>REPORT</code> methods.
		The <code>DELETE</code> method has been cleaned up.
		All HTTP methods are now described in <a href="kcaldav.8.html">kcaldav(8)</a>, including available properties.
		Lots of internal support has been added for iCalendar <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2445#section-4.3.10">recurrence
			rule</a> computation, which is the major stepping stone for processing iCalendar dates, but this is not hooked into
		active use (yet).
